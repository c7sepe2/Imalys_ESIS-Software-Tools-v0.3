## Zones and features

- [Hierarchy of zones](B_Delineate.md#Hierarchy-of-zones)
- [Scalars and thresholds](B_Delineate.md#Scalars-and-thresholds)

One aim of the *ESIS* project is to make the diversity of the landscape structures qualitatively and quantitatively measurable. To this end, we have developed an algorithm that finds and delineates largely homogeneous areas in remote sensing images. The result is a seamless network of polygons, which are referred to below as [zones](../manual/7_Zones.md). *Zones* reflect the GEOBIA paradigm (Blaschke¹).

### Hierarchy of zones

The [zones](../manual/7_Zones.md) largely correspond to the segments in the GEOBIA concept. The [ESIS](../README.md) software tool *Imalys* does not search for gradients or edges in the image but links pixels with most similar characteristics. To do this, *Imalys* determines the variance of all pixels in the entire *zone*, analogous to Rao's ß-diversity (Rocchini², Aisling³).

***Fig.1:** Imalys combines pixels that are as similar as possible to form zones. The process compares all possible combinations of neighboring pixels or zones and adopts the combination with the lowest local diversity (red dots). The process iterates until the average size of the zones reaches a threshold*.

Initially, each pixel is a [zone](../manual/7_Zones.md). The process determines the variance of all possible *zones* resulting from the union of all possible pixel pairs. The *zone* with the smallest variance is registered. The process iterates over all pixels. In the end, only pixels that label each other as the most similar neighbor are merged into *zones*. 

All further runs after the initialization use the same principle. The variance of all possible [zones](../manual/7_Zones.md) from two predecessors determines which *zones* are merged. The algorithm starts with local minima of the variance and gradually works its way up to areas with increasingly higher values. 

All newly combined [zone](../manual/7_Zones.md) inherit the boundaries of their predecessors. Large *zones* combine small *zones* without forming overlaps. This makes it possible to create a hierarchy of *zones* that supports the description of the landscape in more abstract terms.

The hierarchical zone formation saves intermediate results of individual *zones* for each process step. The intermediate results make the calculation much faster, but also require more memory than all other processes on the same image.

### Scalars and thresholds

The [Zones](../manual/7_Zones.md) command calculates the variance of the pixels for each image band separately and then forms the first principal component over all variances to determine a common measure of the “similarity” of the pixels within the *zone*. The two-step process is sensitive to both color and brightness contrasts. 

The process can basically be limited by the size of the [zones](../manual/7_Zones.md) and by the variance within the *zones*. The average size of all *zones* was selected to limit the process. The size of the *zones* is more descriptive than the variance. The threshold can be freely selected. 

In addition, the variance of the size of all resulting *zones* (*bonds =* under [zones](../manual/7_Zones.md)) can be restricted in two stages. For this option, the size or the logarithm of the size is used as an inhibiting factor. This reduces the span between small and large *zones*. In both cases, the ranking of the *zones* sizes is retained, but the differences are strongly leveled, especially in the first case.

A second option (*sieve =*) allows to remove single pixels or small [zones](../manual/7_Zones.md). The option merges all *zones* up to the selected size with the most similar neighboring *zone* that is larger than the passed threshold. As this algorithm also has to iterate, the results can lead to considerable artifacts.

### Features from pixels

To transfer features from pixels to zones, *Imalys* normally uses the mean value of all pixels of the [zone](../manual/7_Zones.md). For kernel processes that map pixel structures within a zone, *Imalys* offers an alternative. 

Standard kernel processes combine all pixels in a small window into a new value that is assigned to the central pixel of the window. The process iterates over all pixels of the image. The result shows a considerable blur effect.

[Zones](../manual/7_Zones.md) follow the natural boundaries in land use. Under [features](../manual/8_Features.md), *zones* can be used as kernels (*normal*, *deviation*). The natural boundaries are retained and small or narrow structures such as roads or streams are given an individual value. For raster images without *zones*, the corresponding raster version under [kernel](../manual/6_Kernel.md) must be used.

------

### Image and vector formats

The [zones](../manual/7_Zones.md) command saves the *zones* as a raster image *index* in the working directory. *Index* contains the zone ID as the value of the pixels. For further processing size, linking and memory addresses of all *zones* and their contacts to other zones are registered at a database *topology.bit*. This database uses a generic format that supports fast processing.

The command also creates an (ESRI) shape file with all *zones* as polygons for convenient evaluation of *zones*. The polygons do not contain any attributes.
