## Imalys Manual

The following pages give an overview how to call and control *Imalys*. 

**[Run Imalys](0_Execute.md):** Set up an control *Imalys* process chains

**[Home:](1_Home.md)** Select a working directory and define paths for protocols.

**[Catalog:](2_Catalog.md)** Create a database with the position and acquisition times of archived image data

**[Import:](3_Import.md)** Select appropriate images from a collection of compressed archives, calibrate the values and cut them to a selected frame.

**[Compile:](4_Compile.md)** Transform, reproject, combine and arrange images as input data for all further commands at a selected frame. 

**[Reduce:](5_Reduce.md)** Combine or compare pixels in different bands, create indices, analyze time series and return principal components.

**[Kernel:](6_Kernel.md)** Combine pixels from the local neighborhood of each pixel to new values, change contrast and filter edges

**[Zones:](7_Zones.md)** Creates a seamless network of image partitions (*zones*) with largely identical characteristics

**[Features:](8_Features.md)** Determine spectral, textural and morphological characteristics of the *zones* and save them as attributes

**[Mapping:](9_Mapping.md)** Classify pixels, *zones* or spatial patterns of *zones* (objects)

**[Compare:](10_Compare.md)** Compare classes with references 

**[Export:](11_Export.md)** Transform processing results into another image format. *Zones* and classes can also be exported in vector format.

**[Replace:](12_Replace.md)** Set and change variables in a process chain. Structurally identical processes can be repeated automatically with different commands and parameters.
